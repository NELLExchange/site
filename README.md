## Developing

The site uses Sapper but is designed to have no back-end.

The CSS framework used is Bulma and Sass is being leveraged for styling.

Yarn is being used for package management.

To run locally simply run `yarn` followed by `yarn dev`.

To build for production, run `yarn export`. To test the production build, `yarn start` can be run after exporting.
